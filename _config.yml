          I started this project as a way of learning <mark>Vue.js</mark> and it has since grown into application for my Master thesis. This project tought me to work with reactive frontend framework and <mark>Node.js</mark> web application framework that served me as backend. This application is used for quick and simple annotation of text that can be later used for training models of any kind.
